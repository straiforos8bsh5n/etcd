For bug reports and other issues tightly related to the repository content
please use the
[github issue tracker](https://github.com/tenbaht/sduino/issues).

For general discussions and suggestions on Sduino it might be more
convinient to open a thread on the
[STM8 board](http://stm32duino.com/viewforum.php?f=52) of the stm32duino
forum. It will help to catch my attention to prefix your topic with
"[sduino]". (After registering on that forum, you are **required** to post
an introduction in the new user board first in order to aquire the right to
post or reply in any other board. Roger is strict on that.)

To send me an email please find my address in the commit messages of the
repository (as a simple captcha test) or use the alias address
sduino@gmx.de

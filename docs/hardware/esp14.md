# ESP-14

An ESP-8266 Wifi-Controller together with a STM8S003 CPU for about $2 -
incredible. I am still waiting for mine to be delivered, so nothing is
tested yet. But the STM8S003 is very similar to the STM8S103 used on the
[STM8S103 breakout boards](stm8blue.html) and I expect all software to run
here as well.
